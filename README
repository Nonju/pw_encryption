README - encryption_project

Readme for an encryption project.

Intended to be a test to see if I could
build an 'encrypter' that converts a users
password in a way that it can't collide with
other passwords (different pw's same encrypted key).
The intention is also to create a key that is 
really hard to decrypt and making it hard
for even the org using the encryption to
try and revert pw's from their Database.

Got idea from a Tom Scott video and wanted 
to try it out myself.
